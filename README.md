# CampSplinterwoodCodeRepository

Camp Splinterwood is a first-person horror game in which the player must use a flashlight to fend off a monster as they attempt to repair their car in order to escape. This game was developed in Unity by a team of ten Bradley University Juniors for a Game Production course. I worked as a programmer on this project with my main focus being creating the monster's AI. This repository contains all of the scripts that I wrote for the monster and its related systems.

The script MonsterAI.cs located in the Core Monster Functionality folder forms the basis of its AI. Also contained within that folder are various 'state' scripts that the monster switches between as its behavior changes. The monster also features an aggression mechanic which causes the monster to become more aggressive toward the player as they progress through the game.
